# Launch Strategy Research: Sol-battles / DegenDome

**Domain:** PvP Skill-Based Crypto Betting Platform (Solana)
**Researched:** 2026-01-21
**Overall Confidence:** MEDIUM-HIGH

---

## Executive Summary

Sol-battles faces the classic two-sided marketplace cold start problem: a PvP platform needs players to attract players. However, research reveals proven playbooks from successful crypto gambling and prediction market launches that directly apply. The key insight: **don't try to launch to "everyone" - launch to a tight, engaged nucleus and let it expand organically.**

The most successful comparable platforms (Polymarket, Pump.fun, Rollbit, Kick.com) all followed variations of the same pattern:
1. Start with a hyper-specific initial audience
2. Create reasons for that audience to bring others
3. Use influencer partnerships strategically (not spray-and-pray)
4. Build community before product is "ready"

Your differentiator ("no house edge, pure PvP, poker for traders") is compelling but needs the right audience to appreciate it. Crypto degens who already understand trading dynamics are your beachhead market.

## Part 1: Where Crypto Degens Hang Out

### Primary Platforms (Ranked by Importance)

#### 1. Twitter/X - The Discovery Layer
**Role:** News breaks here first. Influencer recommendations happen here. Viral moments start here.
- 34.4% of crypto enthusiasts rely on X for information

- Meme coin callers (high overlap with your target audience)

**Confidence:** HIGH (multiple sources confirm)

#### 2. Telegram - The Operations Hub
**Role:** Real-time coordination, alpha sharing, fast communication

- Role-based access for early supporters / top players

**Confidence:** HIGH

#### 4. Kick.com - The Streaming Platform
**Role:** Gambling/betting content streaming (banned from Twitch)

- 200K users in first 24 hours, 10M+ accounts by June 2023
- 95/5 revenue split attracts streamers
- Gambling streamers have massive audiences (Trainwreckstv: $360M deal)

## Part 2: Launch Tactics That Work

### Case Study 1: Polymarket - The Cold Start Master

**How they launched:**
- Created a question with immediate relevance (COVID lockdowns in NYC)
- Founder became the first user and recruited crypto-curious friends
- Simple one-on-one outreach: DMed influencers, posted in subreddits, answered questions
- Kept markets tight (few options) so small user base looked active
- "That initial hustle is mandatory"

**Results:** $9B cumulative trading volume in 2024, 314K active traders/month, $8B valuation

**Applicable Lessons:**
1. Start with one compelling "match type" - don't launch 10 variations
2. Personally recruit your first 50-100 users
3. Create reasons for small groups to cluster (looks more active)
4. DM outreach to micro-influencers who fit your niche

**Confidence:** HIGH (well-documented case study)

### Case Study 2: Pump.fun - Viral Growth Engine

**How they launched:**
- Lowered barriers to near-zero (anyone with Solana wallet can participate)
- No KYC required - teenagers to celebrities joined
- Celebrity adoption created viral moments (Iggy Azalea's $MOTHER hit $240M)
- Community building BEFORE launch is critical: "your coin will appear on the timeline longer as more people buy it"

**Results:** 6M tokens created in first year, 70% of all Solana token launches

**Applicable Lessons:**
1. Make onboarding frictionless (wallet connect only)
2. Create shareable moments (match results, big wins)
3. Build community before launch so there's immediate activity
4. Leverage any celebrity/influencer who finds the concept interesting

**Confidence:** HIGH

### Case Study 3: Rollbit - From Zero to Billions

**How they launched:**
- Started with one innovative game (X-Roulette) that was provably fair
- Added crypto trading to casino (first to do this)
- Airdropped tokens instead of ICO - gave entire supply to users
- Sports sponsorships (Leicester City, FC Napoli, Southampton FC)
- Now: $40M+ daily wagers, $5B total volume

**Key Innovation:** Buy-and-burn mechanism created token value (burned $115M+ worth)

**Applicable Lessons:**
1. Start with one killer feature, not everything
2. "Provably fair" messaging resonates (your "no house edge" is similar)
3. Token airdrops to users creates alignment
4. Sports/esports sponsorships work (consider esports trading teams?)

**Confidence:** HIGH

### Case Study 4: Stake.com/Kick.com - Platform Ecosystem Play

**How they launched:**
- Built massive influencer network (Drake, Israel Adesanya, streamers)
- When Twitch banned gambling, they created Kick.com as alternative
- Paid influencers in unprecedented deals (Trainwreckstv: $360M/18 months)
- $4.7B GGR in 2023 (up 80% YoY)

**Applicable Lessons:**
1. Influencer partnerships at scale work (but expensive)
2. Create your own distribution channel if needed
3. Build relationships with streamers who can showcase gameplay

**Confidence:** HIGH

## Part 3: Waitlist vs Soft Launch vs Partnership Launch

### Option A: Waitlist Strategy

**How it works:**
- Landing page collects signups before launch
- Referral mechanics let people "move up" the list
- Creates exclusivity and anticipation

**Examples:**
- Dropbox: 70,000 emails from simple landing page
- Superhuman: 4 years soft launch, 275K waitlist, manual onboarding

**Pros:**
- Builds anticipation
- Creates email list for launch
- Referral mechanics = free marketing
- Filters for genuinely interested users

**Cons:**
- Risk of hype dying before launch
- Need compelling reason for people to join
- Requires good landing page and value proposition

**Best For:** When you want to control growth and maximize launch impact

**Recommendation for Sol-battles:** INCLUDE as component, but don't rely on alone

### Option B: Soft Launch Strategy

**How it works:**
- Limited release to small group (50-500 users)
- No major promotion
- Active feedback collection and rapid iteration
- "We're still figuring this out. Help us make it better."

**Examples:**
- Linear: Invite-only model, users invite others
- Most successful crypto projects start this way

**Pros:**
- Get real feedback before scaling
- Build core community of invested users
- Fix issues before they become public
- Early users become advocates

**Cons:**
- Slower growth initially
- May lose momentum if too slow
- Requires good feedback loops

**Best For:** Products that need validation, two-sided marketplaces (your situation)

**Recommendation for Sol-battles:** PRIMARY STRATEGY - start here

### Option C: Partnership Launch

**How it works:**
- Launch with established crypto project/influencer
- Their audience becomes your initial users
- Co-marketing amplifies reach

**Examples:**
- Polymarket + Parcl (real estate prediction markets)
- MoonPay + Trust Wallet partnership
- Crypto.com + ERShares collaboration

**Pros:**
- Instant audience access
- Credibility by association
- Shared marketing resources

**Cons:**
- Dependent on partner's audience fit
- May require revenue share
- Less control over messaging

**Best For:** When you can find aligned partner with complementary audience

**Recommendation for Sol-battles:** PURSUE IN PARALLEL - reach out to Solana trading communities, DAOs, etc.

### Recommended Approach: Hybrid Launch

**Phase 1: Pre-Launch (2-4 weeks)**
- Create waitlist with referral mechanics
- Build Discord community (private alpha access for early signups)
- Identify 10-20 micro-influencers in trading/degen space
- Create content showing the concept (videos of matches)

**Phase 2: Soft Launch (4-8 weeks)**
- Invite waitlist in batches (100-200 at a time)
- Run small tournaments with prizes
- Collect feedback obsessively
- Iterate based on what you learn
- Let early users invite friends

**Phase 3: Public Launch**
- Announce broadly when you have proven traction
- Influencer partnerships kick in
- Referral bonuses for existing users
- Potential airdrop to early supporters

## Part 4: Influencer/KOL Partnerships

### Budget Benchmarks (2025 Data)

| Budget Level | What You Get | Best For |
|--------------|--------------|----------|
| $3K-7K/month | 2-3 niche KOLs, 1 YouTube video, basic giveaway | Early-stage projects |
| $10K-20K/month | 5-10 KOLs, multiple platforms, AMAs | Growth stage |
| $30K+/month | Influencer bundles, cross-platform campaigns | Established projects |

### KOL Tiers

**Micro-Influencers (10K-50K followers)**
- 7% conversion rate vs 3% for macro influencers
- More authentic, engaged audiences
- More affordable
- **Recommendation:** Start here

**Mid-Tier (50K-250K followers)**
- Good balance of reach and engagement
- Often willing to take equity/token deals
- Can become long-term partners

**Macro/Celebrity (250K+ followers)**
- Expensive but massive reach
- Less engaged audiences
- Risk of association with controversy (see Stake/Drake)
- **Recommendation:** Only after proven traction

### Finding the Right KOLs

**Ideal Profile for Sol-battles:**
- Already talks about trading (not just shilling)
- Solana-native audience
- History of "degen" content
- Willing to actually play and show results
- Not overexposed to gambling sponsorships

**Where to Find Them:**
- Twitter search: "Solana trading" "crypto degen" "on-chain gambling"
- Check who your target users follow
- Look at who promotes similar products (Drift, Jupiter, etc.)
- Explore Kick.com for gambling-friendly streamers

### Partnership Structures

**Pay-Per-Post:** $500-5K+ depending on reach
- Simple but no alignment

**Revenue Share/Affiliate:** 25-50% of referred user revenue
- Better alignment, performance-based
- Standard in gambling industry (40% of user acquisition)

**Token/Equity:** Compensation in project tokens
- Creates long-term alignment
- Popular in 2025 (performance-based collaborations)
- "Influencers receive part of compensation in project tokens tied to milestones"

**Hybrid:** Base fee + performance bonus
- Best of both worlds
- Recommended approach

### Risk Mitigation

**Disclosure Requirements:**
- FTC and SEC require sponsored content disclosure
- Undisclosed promotions can lead to regulatory fines
- Ensure influencers clearly mark content as sponsored

**Reputation Risk:**
- Vet influencers for controversy history
- Avoid accounts that only shill (no authentic content)
- Gainzy example: switched from Rollbit to Stake, tanked RLB 5%

## Part 5: Community Building Pre-Launch vs Post-Launch

### Pre-Launch Community Building (RECOMMENDED)

**Why Pre-Launch Matters:**
- "If you create a community before you launch, then your [product] will appear... for longer as more people will be buying it"
- "Pre-launch communities are different - members are seeking exclusivity and belonging"
- Creates advocates before you even launch

**Pre-Launch Playbook:**

**Week 1-2: Foundation**
- Set up Discord with clear structure
- Create Twitter account, start posting content
- Join relevant Telegram groups (observe, don't spam)
- Create landing page with waitlist

**Week 3-4: Content & Outreach**
- Post gameplay concepts (videos, screenshots)
- Start DMing potential users and micro-influencers
- Host first Twitter Space to explain concept
- Begin building email list

**Week 5-6: Early Access**
- Invite first 50 users (hand-picked)
- Create private Discord channel for feedback
- Run first test tournaments
- Document and share results

**Week 7-8: Expansion**
- Let early users invite friends
- Announce wider beta access
- Ramp up content production
- Begin influencer conversations

### Discord Pre-Launch Setup

**Essential Channels:**
- #announcements (admin only)
- #general-chat
- #how-it-works (explainer content)
- #feedback
- #match-results (when live)
- #leaderboard
- #strategy-discussion

**Engagement Tactics:**
- Assign special roles to early supporters
- Create private channels for top contributors
- Host weekly AMAs with founders
- Run prediction contests (pre-launch engagement)
- Token-gate exclusive content (if applicable)

### Post-Launch Community Focus

**Shift in Priority:**
- Pre-launch: Exclusivity, belonging, early access
- Post-launch: Retention, engagement, advocacy

**Post-Launch Tactics:**
- Leaderboards and rankings
- Regular tournaments with prizes
- User-generated content (share your wins)
- Community governance input
- Referral programs

## Part 6: Specific Recommendations for Sol-battles

### Your Unique Positioning

**Differentiator:** "No house edge, pure PvP, skill-based - poker for traders"

**Why This Matters:**
- Crypto degens understand that most gambling platforms have house edge
- "Provably fair" resonates - Rollbit built their brand on this
- Skill-based positioning attracts competitive traders
- PvP creates natural virality (winners want to share, losers want revenge)

### Target Audience Segments

**Primary: Solana Degens**
- Already on Solana, understand the ecosystem
- Trade meme coins, use Jupiter/Drift
- Active on CT, Discord alpha groups
- Comfortable with risk, seek alpha

**Secondary: Poker Players in Crypto**
- CoinPoker users (they already have crypto futures trading game)
- Understand skill-based competition
- Used to PvP dynamics
- Looking for new edges

**Tertiary: Prediction Market Users**
- Polymarket, Drift BET users
- Understand betting on outcomes
- May want faster, more active format

### Cold Start Solution

**The Problem:** PvP platform needs players to attract players

**The Solution:** "Constrain to expand"

1. **Start with ONE match type** - Don't launch 10 variations. Pick your best one.
2. **Set specific match times** - Instead of "play anytime," have scheduled tournaments (creates crowds)
3. **Founder/Team play** - Polymarket founder was first user. Be willing to play.
4. **Small stakes, high frequency** - Lower barrier to first match
5. **Spectator mode** - Let people watch before playing (reduces commitment needed)

### Recommended Launch Sequence

**Phase 0: Stealth (Now - Week 2)**
- Polish one match type
- Create all social accounts
- Build basic landing page
- Identify 20 potential early users from your network

**Phase 1: Friends & Family (Weeks 2-4)**
- Invite 50-100 people you know or can reach
- Run daily tournaments at set times
- Collect feedback, iterate fast
- Document everything (for content)

**Phase 2: Expand to Community (Weeks 4-8)**
- Open waitlist
- Let existing users invite friends
- Start Twitter content (match highlights, strategy tips)
- Reach out to 5-10 micro-influencers
- Host first Twitter Space

**Phase 3: Soft Public Launch (Weeks 8-12)**
- Open to waitlist
- First paid influencer partnerships
- Regular tournament schedule
- Referral program active
- Potential airdrop announcement

**Phase 4: Full Launch (Week 12+)**
- Public announcement
- Larger influencer campaign
- Consider token launch / airdrop
- Sports/esports partnerships

---

## Part 7: Airdrop Strategy Considerations

### Why Airdrops Work for Betting Platforms

- Rollbit airdropped entire token supply - created user alignment
- "Properly executed airdrops generate 3-5x higher retention rates compared to paid advertising"
- Creates immediate community of token holders invested in success

### Airdrop Structures to Consider

**Task-Based Airdrop:**
- Reward users for: completing matches, inviting friends, engaging on social
- "Perfect for user acquisition and social proof"
- Filters for active users, not just collectors

**Retroactive Airdrop:**
- Reward early users based on activity (matches played, volume)
- Creates "play to earn" dynamic
- Polymarket-style approach

**Tiered Distribution:**
- Plume example: "smaller instant reward or larger delayed claim"
- Gamifies the claiming process
- Encourages ongoing engagement

### Airdrop Timing

**Pre-Token:** Announce "future airdrop" to early users
- Creates incentive to use platform before token exists
- Documents activity for later distribution

**Post-Traction:** Only launch token after product-market fit
- "Stake launched casino first, token later"
- Token amplifies what's working, doesn't fix what's broken

## Part 8: Metrics to Track

### Pre-Launch Metrics
- Waitlist signups
- Discord members
- Twitter followers
- Email open rates
- Referral rate

### Soft Launch Metrics
- Daily Active Users (DAU)
- Matches per day
- Average match value
- Retention (D1, D7, D30)

- Feedback quality

### Post-Launch Metrics
- User acquisition cost (CAC)
- Lifetime value (LTV)
- LTV:CAC ratio (should be >3:1)
- Viral coefficient (referrals per user)
- Gross gaming revenue (if applicable)

### Industry Benchmarks
- Average CAC in crypto gambling: $125
- Average LTV: $890
- Crypto platforms achieve 37% higher retention than traditional
- Affiliate marketing drives 40% of new signups

## Key Takeaways

1. **Don't launch to everyone - launch to 50-100 hand-picked users first**
2. **Build community pre-launch in Discord/Telegram**
3. **Polymarket's playbook is your playbook: one market, tight community, manual hustle**
4. **Micro-influencers (10K-50K) outperform macro for conversion**
5. **Set specific match times to create artificial crowds**
6. **"No house edge" is your differentiator - make it central to messaging**
7. **Soft launch first, public launch after you have traction**
8. **Consider airdrop to early users after proving product-market fit**

The fear of "launching to zero users" is valid, but the solution is not to avoid launching - it's to launch small, to the right people, with the right message, and grow from there.
