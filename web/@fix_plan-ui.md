# UI Fix Plan

## IMPORTANT
**Battle Mode is on hold - focus on existing pages and mobile responsiveness**

## High Priority
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness for Oracle page
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness for Progression page
- [ ] User profile page styling (when Frontend builds it)
- [ ] Leaderboard page improvements

## Medium Priority
- [ ] Loading state animations
- [ ] Hover effects consistency
- [ ] Button press feedback
- [ ] Toast notifications styling
- [ ] Modal/dialog designs

## Low Priority
- [ ] Dark/light theme toggle
- [ ] Micro-animations (confetti on wins, etc.)
- [ ] Custom scrollbar styling
- [ ] Skeleton loading states

## On Hold
- [ ] Battle Mode UI design - waiting for smart contract
- [ ] Draft Mode UI design - waiting for page to be built

## Completed
- [x] Oracle page layout optimization
- [x] Button visibility fixes (contrast)
- [x] Progression page styling
- [x] Coming soon page design
- [x] Sidebar and rules section sizing

## Notes
- Mobile-first approach
- Maintain visual hierarchy
- Keep animations subtle and performant
- Test on real devices when possible
