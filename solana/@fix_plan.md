# Solana Fix Plan

## IMPORTANT - ALL SMART CONTRACTS ARE WITH EXTERNAL AUDITORS
**DO NOT MODIFY ANY SMART CONTRACT CODE**

All programs (prediction_program, battle_program, draft_program) have been handed off for audit.
No changes should be made until audit is complete and contracts are deployed to mainnet.

## Current Status
- [x] Prediction Program - Complete, sent for audit
- [x] Battle Program - Complete, sent for audit
- [x] Draft Program - Complete, sent for audit

## Waiting For
- [ ] Audit results from external team
- [ ] Mainnet deployment approval

## Notes
This worker has no active tasks until audit is complete.
EXIT_SIGNAL should be true - nothing to do here.
