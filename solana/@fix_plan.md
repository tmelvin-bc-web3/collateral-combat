# Solana Fix Plan

## IMPORTANT
**Battle Program is handled by external developers - DO NOT MODIFY battle_program/**

## High Priority
- [ ] Draft Program - Pool creation instruction
- [ ] Draft Program - Player selection logic
- [ ] Draft Program - Score tracking system
- [ ] Draft Program - Prize distribution

## Medium Priority
- [ ] Prediction Program - Multi-asset support (ETH, BTC, etc.)
- [ ] Prediction Program - Variable round durations
- [ ] Mainnet deployment preparation for prediction_program

## Low Priority
- [ ] Program upgrade mechanisms
- [ ] Emergency pause functionality
- [ ] Admin controls and governance

## Completed
- [x] Prediction Program - Basic betting
- [x] Prediction Program - Round creation
- [x] Prediction Program - Settlement logic
- [x] Prediction Program - Rake calculation
- [x] Battle Program - EXTERNAL DEVS (do not touch)

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] All instruction handlers tested
- [ ] Edge cases covered
- [ ] Error conditions verified
- [ ] Mainnet simulation run

## Notes
- Focus on Draft Program since Battle is external
- Always test on devnet before mainnet
- Keep program size optimized
- Document all state account structures
