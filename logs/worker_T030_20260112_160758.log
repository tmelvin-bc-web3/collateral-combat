- web/tailwind.config.ts (created)
Verification: PASS

```

**Summary of changes:**

1. **ThemeContext.tsx** - Created a new theme context with:
   - Type-safe `Theme` type (`'dark' | 'light'`)
   - `ThemeProvider` component that manages theme state
   - `useTheme` hook for consuming theme in components
   - localStorage persistence with key `degendome-theme`
   - System preference detection (prefers-color-scheme)
   - Applies `dark`/`light` class to document root for Tailwind's class-based dark mode
   - Prevents flash of wrong theme by not rendering until mounted

2. **tailwind.config.ts** - Converted from JS to TypeScript with:
   - Proper `Config` type from tailwindcss
   - `darkMode: ['class']` already configured (was in the JS file)
   - All existing color, font, and theme configurations preserved

The theme system:
- Persists user preference to localStorage
- Falls back to system preference if no stored preference
- Defaults to dark theme (matching the existing app design)
- Components can use `useTheme()` to access `theme`, `toggleTheme()`, and `setTheme()`
