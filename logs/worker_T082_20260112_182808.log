The Oracle page is working correctly. I can see:
1. The "RECENT" section shows real round data (the colored tiles with percentages)
2. The sidebar shows "Wallet: Not connected" and "BET AMOUNT: 0.1 SOL" - no mock bettors
3. No mock data visible - the left sidebar with fake bettors like "CryptoKing", "DegenApe" is gone
4. No mock history panel on the right with fake rounds

The task is complete. The mock data has been successfully removed from the Oracle page, and the sidebars now show empty states or real data only.
