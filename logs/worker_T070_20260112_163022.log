**Summary of changes:**
- Removed duplicate countdown from the "Timer & Price Display" card in `page.tsx` (lines 618-669)
- Removed the large countdown number (`{timeRemaining}`)
- Removed "Final price decides." text from that card
- Kept the price display, status label ("Betting Open"/"Locked"/"Starting..."), and progress bar
- Only ONE countdown now exists - inside the chart (RealtimeChart.tsx), positioned top-right with just the number and "Final price decides." text below
