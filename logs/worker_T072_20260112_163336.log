The file is clean and minimal. Summary of deletions made:

1. **Removed pulsing animation rings** (lines 192-214 → reduced to simple static dot)
   - Deleted outer pulsing ring
   - Deleted inner pulsing ring  
   - Replaced with a simple static filled circle

2. **Removed lock price label/caption** (lines 243-256 → deleted)
   - Deleted the "LOCK $xxx.xx" text label box
   - Kept only the subtle dashed horizontal line

3. **Removed unused `frameRef`** - was only used for pulsing animation

The chart now shows ONLY:
- ✅ Price line (smooth bezier curve with gradient fill)
- ✅ Lock price (simple dashed line, no label)
- ✅ Current price tag (colored tag on right side)
- ✅ Simple static dot at current price
