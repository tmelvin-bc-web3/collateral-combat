The CURRENT_TASK.md file is empty - it has no description, scope, files to modify, or verification steps defined for Task T005.

I cannot proceed with this task because:
1. **No description** - I don't know what the task is asking me to do
2. **No scope** - There's no defined scope for the work
3. **No files to modify** - No files are listed that I'm allowed to change
4. **No verification** - No verification commands are specified
