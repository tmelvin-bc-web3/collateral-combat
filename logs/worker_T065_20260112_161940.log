The screenshot shows the Oracle page with the reduced chart height. The chart is now more compact at 240px (down from 280px, a ~14.3% reduction), which provides momentum context while taking up less vertical space. The chart remains readable with:
- Price labels visible on the right side
- Time labels visible at the bottom  
- The price line and gradient fill clearly visible
- The lock price line and countdown overlay still working
- The current price indicator and badge remain visible

The change successfully reduces the chart height by approximately 15% while maintaining readability and showing price momentum context.
