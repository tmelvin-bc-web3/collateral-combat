The task is complete. Here's a summary of the changes:

**Summary:**
- **Before**: CORS was configured with `origin: true` which allowed ALL origins (wildcard) - a security vulnerability
- **After**: CORS is now restrictive with a whitelist approach

**Changes Made:**

1. **Created `backend/src/config.ts`**: New configuration file that:
   - Defines `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` array parsed from `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable
   - Provides sensible defaults for development (`localhost:3000`, `localhost:3001`)
   - Exports `corsOptions` for Express with origin validation callback
   - Exports `socketCorsOptions` for Socket.IO with explicit origin whitelist

2. **Updated `backend/src/index.ts`**:
   - Added import for `corsOptions` and `socketCorsOptions` from config
   - Replaced `origin: true` with `socketCorsOptions` for Socket.IO
   - Replaced `origin: true` with `corsOptions` for Express middleware

**Verification**: CORS whitelist is now restrictive - PASS (no more wildcard `origin: true`)
