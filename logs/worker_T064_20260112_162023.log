Task: T064
Status: DONE
Files modified: web/src/app/predict/page.tsx
Verification: PASS

Summary of changes:
1. Added `hasBetThisRound` and `currentRoundId` state variables to track bet placement
2. Reset bet state when a new round starts via socket event
3. Set `hasBetThisRound = true` after successful bet placement (all bet paths: free bet, on-chain, off-chain)

Pre-bet state (right sidebar):
- "Ready to Bet" card with pulsing indicator
- "Rules of the Oracle" - 3 numbered rules
- NO pool sizes, NO long/short counts visible

Post-bet state (right sidebar):
- "Bet Locked" confirmation banner with checkmark
- "Live Stats" section with full round statistics:
  - Total Pool
  - Longs/Shorts counts with pool amounts
  - Pool ratio bar visualization
  - Live odds for both sides
- Compact de-emphasized rules reminder

Clean state transition using:
- `transition-all duration-300 ease-out` for smooth animations
- `animate-fadeIn` for post-bet state appearance
- Proper conditional rendering with `{!hasBetThisRound && ...}` / `{hasBetThisRound && ...}`
