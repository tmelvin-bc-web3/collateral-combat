All verifications pass. Let me provide a summary:

## Summary

**Task T001: Scan codebase for exposed API keys and secrets**

### Findings:

1. **Source code files (.ts, .tsx, .js)**: No hardcoded secrets found. All API keys are properly loaded from environment variables:
   - `backend/src/services/coinMarketCapService.ts` uses `process.env.CMC_API_KEY`
   - `web/src/lib/nftApi.ts` uses `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_HELIUS_API_KEY`

2. **Environment files**: Properly gitignored
   - `backend/.env` - contains CMC_API_KEY (gitignored)
   - `web/.env.local` - contains HELIUS_API_KEY (gitignored)

3. **Issue Found & Fixed**: `.telegram_config` file containing a Telegram bot token was NOT in `.gitignore`. This file could have been accidentally committed to git.

### Action Taken:
- Added `.telegram_config` to `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commit of Telegram credentials

### Non-issues:
- Solana public keys (program IDs, wallet addresses) in source code are public by design
- Mock/simulation wallet addresses in `battleSimulator.ts` are test data, not real secrets
