The CURRENT_TASK.md file shows Task T013, but the task details are empty - there is no Description, Scope, Files to Modify, or Verification commands specified.

I cannot proceed with an empty task definition. I have no:
- Description of what to do
- Scope of work
- Files I'm allowed to modify
- Verification commands to run

```
---TASK_BLOCKED---
Task: T013
Reason: Task definition is empty. No description, scope, files to modify, or verification commands are specified in CURRENT_TASK.md. Cannot proceed without knowing what work needs to be done.
---END_TASK---
