All changes are in place. Let me summarize the polish improvements made:

**Changes Summary:**

1. **Smoother Bezier Curves:**
   - Added `CURVE_TENSION = 0.25` constant for consistent curve smoothness
   - Improved Catmull-Rom spline implementation with cleaner boundary handling

2. **Cleaner Colors:**
   - Updated UP_COLOR to `#22c55e` (Green-500 - more vibrant)
   - Updated DOWN_COLOR to `#ef4444` (Red-500 - clearer contrast)
   - Grid color reduced to 0.03 opacity (more subtle)
   - Text color increased to 0.4 opacity (more readable)
   - Gradient fill now color-matched to line direction

3. **No Jank - Animation Improvements:**
   - Added `lastFrameTimeRef` for frame timing control
   - Implemented 60 FPS frame rate limiting (`TARGET_FPS`, `FRAME_DURATION`)
   - Delta-based smoothing for consistent animation speed regardless of frame rate
   - Replaced `ctx.filter = 'blur()'` with `ctx.shadowBlur` for better performance
   - Reduced smoothing factors for gentler transitions (`0.12` for price, `0.04` for axis)

4. **Visual Polish:**
   - Softer glow effect using shadowBlur instead of filter blur
   - Cleaner pulse animation using normalized sine wave
   - Updated price tag design with white text on colored background
   - Repositioned tick direction arrow (beside tag instead of below)
   - Refined badge and lock price line styling
   - Thinner, more elegant line widths
