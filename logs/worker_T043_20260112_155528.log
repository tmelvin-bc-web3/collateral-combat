The implementation is complete. Let me summarize what was added:

1. **New refs** (lines 30-31):
   - `lastTickDirectionRef` - Tracks whether the last tick was 'up' or 'down'
   - `previousTickPriceRef` - Stores the previous price to compare with the current one

2. **Direction tracking logic** (lines 441-450 in `handlePriceUpdate`):
   - Compares the current price with the previous price
   - Sets direction to 'up' if price increased, 'down' if decreased
   - Keeps previous direction if price is unchanged

3. **Arrow drawing code** (lines 272-295):
   - Draws a triangle arrow below the price tag at the right edge
   - Green (UP_COLOR: #10b981) pointing up if tick direction is 'up'
   - Red (DOWN_COLOR: #f43f5e) pointing down if tick direction is 'down'
