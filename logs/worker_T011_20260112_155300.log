## Summary of Changes

Made the leaderboard page mobile responsive for 375px and 768px breakpoints:

1. **Time Filter Buttons**: Changed from flex to grid layout on mobile (4 columns), showing only icons at 375px with labels appearing at `sm` breakpoint. Buttons stack vertically within each cell for better touch targets.

2. **Top 3 Podium Cards**: Restructured to use a horizontal flex layout on mobile (rank badge on left, content on right) and centered layout on tablet/desktop. The rank title badges (Warlord, Lieutenant, Sergeant) are now inline on mobile instead of absolutely positioned.

3. **First Place Card**: Reduced padding on mobile, smaller stat text sizes, better compact layout while maintaining visual hierarchy.

4. **Your Stats Section**: Reduced margins, padding, and font sizes for mobile. The stats grid maintains 2 columns on mobile and expands to 4 on md breakpoint.

All changes use standard Tailwind responsive prefixes (`sm:`, `md:`) for consistent breakpoint behavior at 375px (base) and 768px (md).
