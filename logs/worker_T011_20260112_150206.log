The CURRENT_TASK.md file shows Task T011 but has empty fields for Description, Scope, Files to Modify, and Verification. There is no actual task defined for me to complete.

```
---TASK_BLOCKED---
Task: T011
Reason: Task definition is incomplete - Description, Scope, Files to Modify, and Verification sections are all empty. Cannot proceed without knowing what work needs to be done.
---END_TASK---
```
