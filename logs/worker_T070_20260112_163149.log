Build passes successfully. The implementation is already correct and meets all the task requirements:

1. **ONLY ONE countdown exists** - inside the chart in the top-right corner (RealtimeChart.tsx lines 531-556)
2. **NO card/background/label** - the countdown is just the number with an orange glow effect
3. **"Final price decides." text** - shown below the number (optional as per requirements)  
4. **No duplicate countdowns** - verified by code review and visual inspection
