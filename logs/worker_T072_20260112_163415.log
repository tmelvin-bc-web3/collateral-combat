The chart is now stripped to bare essentials and looks quiet:

**What remains (essentials only):**
- Price line (smooth green/red curve with gradient fill)
- Lock price line (dashed horizontal line - no label)
- Current price tag ($143.49 in green pill on right)
- Simple dot at current price point

**What was deleted:**
- Grid lines (horizontal)
- Price labels on Y-axis
- Time labels at bottom (0s, 30s, 60s)
- Percentage change badge
- Tick direction arrows
- Pulsing animation on dot (simplified to static dot)
- Lock price label ("LOCK $X.XX")
- Countdown overlay with timer
- "Connecting to price feed..." text

The chart feels quiet and minimal as required.
