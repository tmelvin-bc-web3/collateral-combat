The CURRENT_TASK.md file exists but the task details are empty - there is no Description, Scope, Files to Modify, or Verification commands specified for Task T003.

I cannot proceed with this task because:
1. **No Description** - I don't know what work needs to be done
2. **No Scope** - I don't know what area of the codebase this affects
3. **No Files to Modify** - I have no authorized files to change
4. **No Verification** - I don't know how to verify the work

```
---TASK_BLOCKED---
Task: T003
Reason: Task definition is incomplete - Description, Scope, Files to Modify, and Verification sections are all empty in CURRENT_TASK.md. Cannot execute a task without knowing what to do or which files are in scope.
---END_TASK---
