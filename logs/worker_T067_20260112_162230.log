The changes are clearly visible. The bet amount selector at the bottom is now:
1. **Smaller container** - reduced padding (`p-2 md:p-3` vs old `p-3 md:p-4`)
2. **Reduced glow/contrast** - the selected button (0.1) has a subtle style, MAX button has muted colors
3. **Secondary feel** - the header "AMOUNT (SOL)" is smaller and in tertiary text color
4. **Visually de-emphasized** - the entire container has `opacity-80` and border is more muted

The Long/Short buttons remain the primary focus with their vibrant colors and prominent glow effects, while the amount selector fades into the background as a secondary control.
