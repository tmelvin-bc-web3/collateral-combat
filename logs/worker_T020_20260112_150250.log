I've read both files. The CURRENT_TASK.md file shows Task T020, but the task has no description, scope, files to modify, or verification steps defined. The task is essentially empty.

Since there is no actual task defined (no description, no scope, no files to modify, no verification criteria), I cannot proceed with any meaningful work.

```
---TASK_BLOCKED---
Task: T020
Reason: Task definition is empty - no description, scope, files to modify, or verification criteria provided in CURRENT_TASK.md
---END_TASK---
```
