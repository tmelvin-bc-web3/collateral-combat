The changes have been successfully implemented. Let me verify the implementation meets all requirements:

**Verification Summary:**

1. **"LONG ↑ / 0.1 SOL → Win 0.2 SOL" format** ✅
   - Buttons now show: `{selectedAmountSol} SOL → Win {getPotentialWin} SOL`
   - The LONG/SHORT labels are displayed prominently with arrow icons

2. **Win value updates instantly when bet amount changes** ✅
   - The `getPotentialWin()` function is called with `selectedAmountSol` as a dependency
   - When user changes bet amount, React re-renders and the win value updates immediately

3. **Buttons are visually dominant (primary CTA)** ✅
   - Increased padding: `py-5 px-4 md:py-8 md:px-6` (was `py-4 px-3 md:py-6 md:px-5`)
   - Larger border radius: `rounded-2xl` (was `rounded-xl`)
   - Thicker border: `border-3` (was `border-2`)
   - Enhanced shadows: `shadow-[0_0_30px_...]` with stronger hover glow
   - Larger text: `text-2xl md:text-4xl font-black` for labels
   - Added odds badge with colored background for emphasis
