I've read both files. The CURRENT_TASK.md file is essentially empty - it has the template structure but no actual task defined:

- **Description**: Empty
- **Scope**: Empty
- **Files to Modify**: Empty
- **Verification**: Empty

There is no task defined for me to work on.

```
---TASK_BLOCKED---
Task: T001
Reason: CURRENT_TASK.md is empty - no task description, scope, files to modify, or verification steps have been specified. Cannot proceed without a defined task.
---END_TASK---
```
