The CURRENT_TASK.md file shows Task T010 but the **Description**, **Scope**, **Files to Modify**, and **Verification** sections are all empty. There is no actual task defined for me to execute.

```
---TASK_BLOCKED---
Task: T010
Reason: Task definition is incomplete - Description, Scope, Files to Modify, and Verification sections are all empty in CURRENT_TASK.md. Cannot proceed without knowing what work needs to be done.
---END_TASK---
```
