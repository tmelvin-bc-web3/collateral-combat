My changes are in place:
- Line 626: Shows `SOL/USD` only (no "from $X" helper text)
- Line 627: Shows the single price display `$animatedPrice.toFixed(2)`

The task requirements within my allowed scope have been met:
- ✓ ONE price display only ("$143.41" format) with "SOL/USD" above it
- ✓ Deleted "from $X" helper text
