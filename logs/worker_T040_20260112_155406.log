The changes are complete. Let me summarize what was done:

**Changes Made:**

1. **`web/src/app/globals.css`** - Added a new CSS animation `oracleCountdownGlow` that creates a pulsing orange glow effect:
   - Animates from 0.4 opacity to 0.8 opacity
   - Uses 1s ease-in-out timing
   - Applied via the `.oracle-countdown-glow` class

2. **`web/src/app/predict/page.tsx`** - Enhanced the countdown timer (lines 470-476):
   - Increased size from `text-4xl md:text-6xl` to `text-5xl md:text-8xl` (~25-30% larger)
   - Added `oracle-countdown-glow` class for the pulsing orange glow effect
   - Changed default color from `text-text-primary` to `text-warning` (orange) when time > 10 seconds to match the glow theme
   - Timer is positioned prominently in the card above the chart
