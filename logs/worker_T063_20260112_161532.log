All tasks are complete. Let me provide a summary of what was implemented:

## Summary

I implemented the Oracle hover commitment effect with the following changes:

### Files Modified:
1. **web/src/app/globals.css** - Added CSS for hover commitment effect (lines 1318-1387)
2. **web/src/app/predict/page.tsx** - Added commitment classes to elements (lines 581, 585, 607, 665, 709, 815)

### Implementation Details:
- **CSS-only approach** using the `:has()` selector to detect button hover states at the container level
- When hovering over Long or Short button, the entire UI dims to **70% opacity** (`opacity: 0.7`)
- The **hovered button remains at full opacity** (`opacity: 1 !important`)
- Smooth **150ms transition** for both dimming and un-dimming
- **Respects prefers-reduced-motion**: The effect is disabled for users with reduced motion preference (no transition, no opacity change)

### Classes Applied:
- `oracle-commitment-container` - Parent wrapper on the grid container
- `oracle-dimmable` - Applied to: chart card, timer card, sidebar
- `oracle-btn-long` - Applied to Long button
- `oracle-btn-short` - Applied to Short button

### Verification:
- TypeScript compilation: PASS
- Next.js build: PASS
- CSS compiled correctly with all classes present
