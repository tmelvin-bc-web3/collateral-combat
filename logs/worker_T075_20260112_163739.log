**Summary of changes:**
- Removed unused `getDisplayAmount` function (dead code cleanup)
- Win amounts remain ONLY inside Long/Short buttons: `{selectedAmountSol} SOL → Win {getPotentialWin('long').toFixed(2)} SOL`
- No standalone "Potential Return" card exists (was already removed)
- Sidebar was simplified by linter to show only wallet + bet amount (removed duplicate stats displays)
