**Summary of changes made:**

1. **Selected state styling improvements** - Bet amount buttons now have:
   - Bright ring outline: `ring-2 ring-accent ring-offset-2 ring-offset-bg-primary`
   - Glow effect: `shadow-[0_0_12px_rgba(139,92,246,0.5)]`
   - Pressed appearance: `scale-[0.97] translate-y-px`
   - Smooth transition: `transition-all duration-150`

2. **Win values update immediately** - Already implemented in the file (win values are calculated using `getPotentialWin()` which depends on `selectedAmountSol` state, so they update immediately when the amount changes)

3. **MAX button added** - Added an optional MAX button in the grid:
   - Positioned at the end of the bet amount buttons
   - Uses warning color scheme for visibility
   - Same selected state styling (ring + glow + pressed) with warning colors
   - Selects the highest bet amount (0.5 SOL)
   - Grid updated to 6 columns on larger screens to accommodate
