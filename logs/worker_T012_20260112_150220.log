I've read both files. The CURRENT_TASK.md file shows Task T012, but it has **empty fields** for:
- Description
- Scope
- Files to Modify
- Verification

This task has no defined work to do. There's no description, no scope, no files to modify, and no verification steps.

```
---TASK_BLOCKED---
Task: T012
Reason: Task definition is empty - no description, scope, files to modify, or verification steps are specified in CURRENT_TASK.md
---END_TASK---
```
