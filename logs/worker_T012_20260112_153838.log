All tasks completed. The implementation includes:

1. **Mobile hamburger button** - Shows on screens smaller than `md` breakpoint (768px), with a hamburger icon that toggles to an X icon when menu is open
2. **Mobile menu dropdown** - Full-width dropdown below the header with all primary and secondary nav items styled consistently with the desktop design
3. **Close on navigation** - `useEffect` that watches `pathname` changes and closes the mobile menu when user navigates
4. **Click outside to close** - Extended the existing click-outside handler to also close the mobile menu
