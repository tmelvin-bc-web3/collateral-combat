There are 6 remaining unchecked stories in the PRD (US-004 through US-009). Since not all stories are complete, I should NOT output the completion signal.

**Summary of US-003 completion:**

- **T220:** Updated `RoundStatus` enum from `Open` to `Betting` in `types.ts` to match the smart contract. Also updated `parseRound()` in `client.ts` to check for `betting` status instead of `open`.

- **T223:** Removed three dead code methods from `client.ts`:
  - `initializeRound()` - The contract has `initialize_game` but no separate round initialization
  - `lockRound()` - Locking happens automatically via time-based logic
  - `settleRound()` - Settlement happens via the `crank` instruction
  
  Also removed the unused `priceToScaled` import.

- **Verification:** `npm run build` passes with no TypeScript errors.

- **Commits:** 
  - `6653a8f` - US-003: Frontend Types and Client - completed by Ralph
  - `308ced9` - Add progress entry and run summary for US-003
