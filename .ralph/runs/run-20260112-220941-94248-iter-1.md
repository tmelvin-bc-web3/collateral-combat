# Run Summary: US-003 - Frontend Types and Client

**Run ID:** 20260112-220941-94248
**Iteration:** 1
**Status:** COMPLETED

## Story Details
- **ID:** US-003
- **Title:** Frontend Types and Client
- **Description:** Fix type definitions and clean up prediction client

## Tasks Completed
- [x] T220: Update RoundStatus type to match contract (Betting/Locked/Settled)
- [x] T223: Remove dead code from client.ts (initializeRound, lockRound, settleRound)

## Changes Made

### web/src/lib/prediction/types.ts
- Changed `RoundStatus.Open` to `RoundStatus.Betting` to match the smart contract enum

### web/src/lib/prediction/client.ts
- Removed `initializeRound()` method (74 lines) - not a real contract instruction
- Removed `lockRound()` method - not a real contract instruction
- Removed `settleRound()` method - not a real contract instruction
- Updated `parseRound()` to check for `betting` status instead of `open`
- Removed unused `priceToScaled` import
- Updated exports to remove `priceToScaled`

## Verification
- **Command:** `npm run build` (web directory)
- **Result:** PASS - TypeScript compiles successfully with no errors

## Commit
- **Hash:** 6653a8f
- **Message:** US-003: Frontend Types and Client - completed by Ralph

## Key Learnings
1. The smart contract uses `RoundStatus::Betting` (not Open) for rounds accepting bets
2. There are no separate `lock_round` or `settle_round` instructions in the contract
3. Round lifecycle is managed via the `crank` instruction which settles current round and starts next
4. The usePrediction hook uses lowercase string status internally ('betting', 'locked', 'settled')
